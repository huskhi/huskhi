## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on contributing to the open source community and building something cool at the intersection of AI and impact.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
      - how to make AI models not just accurate, but useful in the wild â€” plus keeping up with the coolest new AI updates.
      - to push the limits of ML (and occasionally my laptopâ€™s GPU ðŸ˜…)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on creative ML/AI projects
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: : I have too many models in my life - most of them are ML, not runway.
